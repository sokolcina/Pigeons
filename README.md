# Pigeons
 About a simulation: 
 
 Pigeons are waiting for food in the park. In the simulation, the dove is a square of 10 pixels and the food is a circle of 10 pixels. The user by left clicking on the park adds food, for the pigeons he must click on the “insert pigeon”, and when he finishes inserting it again clicks the button. If there is no food in the park, the pigeon is always still, otherwise the pigeon goes for fresh food. Pigeons only eat fresh food. Pigeons are sometimes scared and then change their temporary position.
